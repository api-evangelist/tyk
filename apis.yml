      The Tyk Dashboard API offers granular, programmatic access to a
      centralised database of resources that your Tyk nodes can pull from. This
      API has a dynamic user administrative structure which means the secret key
      that is used to communicate with your Tyk nodes can be kept secret and
      access to the wider management functions can be handled on a user-by-user
      and organisation-by-organisation basis.

      For Tyk On-Premises installations, the Dashboard Admin API provides two
      endpoints for setting up and provisioning a Tyk Dashboard instance without
      using the command line. To use the API, retrieve the admin_secret value
      from your Tyk Dashboard configuration. This secret must be included as a
      header in every Dashboard Admin API request for successful authentication.

    description: >-
      The Tyk Gateway API is the primary means for integrating your application
      with the Tyk API Gateway system. This API is very small, and has no
      granular permissions system. It is intended to be used purely for internal
      automation and integration.
